# Wafer_Fault_DEtection_Project

## Introduction

Wafer fault detection is a crucial task in the semiconductor industry to ensure the quality and reliability of integrated circuits (ICs) produced on silicon wafers. Identifying and categorizing faults or defects in wafers is essential to prevent faulty chips from reaching the market, thereby reducing production costs and improving customer satisfaction.

This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive solution for wafer fault detection, utilizing machine learning techniques and computer vision algorithms. The project aims to provide an efficient and accurate method for detecting and classifying faults on silicon wafers, enabling semiconductor manufacturers to enhance their quality control processes.

## Features

1. **Preprocessing and Data Augmentation:** The repository provides robust preprocessing techniques for wafer images, including noise reduction, image enhancement, and data augmentation. These steps ensure that the input data is optimized for subsequent analysis and model training.

2. **Machine Learning Models:** The project implements state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning architectures, to learn and classify various types of wafer faults. These models are designed to handle large-scale datasets and capture intricate patterns in wafer images, resulting in accurate fault detection.

3. **Fault Classification:** The repository includes trained models that can effectively classify different types of wafer faults, including scratches, contamination, and circuit pattern deviations. The fault classification module provides detailed insights into the nature of detected faults, enabling rapid identification and rectification of manufacturing issues.

4. **Interactive Visualization:** To facilitate easy interpretation of the results, the project incorporates interactive visualization tools. These tools allow users to explore and analyze the detected faults, visualize their spatial distribution on the wafers, and gain valuable insights for process improvement.

5. **Scalability and Customization:** The architecture of the project is designed to be scalable, allowing easy integration with existing wafer inspection systems. Moreover, the codebase is modular and well-documented, enabling customization and extension to address specific requirements or accommodate new fault types.
